Today I'm writing about Pandas in Python! I've used the Pandas library a few times and I find it incredibly useful to handle all data wrangling tasks...there's so much you can do with Pandas that I've only scratched the surface. So I'm going to demonstrate a few of its features here so that I keep forgetting for the lack of practice.

So there you have it, a quick introduction to some very useful operations using python pandas. If you are new to pandas, I hope this has sparked your curiosity to learn more about it and if you're already familiar with using pandas, I hope that you've enjoyed my take on using pandas. Either way please leave questions and/ or comments. I will be back with more posts very soon!
